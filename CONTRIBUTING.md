# Contributing to Awesome List

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this awesome list as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Discussing the current state of the list
- Proposing new apps

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
We use GitHub Flow. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Issue that pull request!

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
